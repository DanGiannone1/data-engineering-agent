## Working Philosophy

Always think from a **top-down, end-to-end system architecture perspective**. Do not prioritize finishing the task — prioritize getting it right.

- **Ask before assuming.** If you're unsure about the broader context, go back to the human and check in. Seeking guidance is always better than going down the wrong path.
- **Solving a problem without understanding the broader context yields worse results in the long run for the rest of the team.** Take the time to understand how a change fits into the overall system before implementing it.
- **Don't optimize for speed of completion.** Optimize for correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence.
- **Simplify relentlessly.** Always look for opportunities to remove complexity rather than add it. A clean, simple MVP that works is far more valuable than a hardened system full of edge-case checks that nobody can reason about. Spaghetti code is the real risk — not missing edge cases.
- **Keeping the codebase clean and simple is the highest priority.** If a change makes things harder to understand, it's probably the wrong change.
